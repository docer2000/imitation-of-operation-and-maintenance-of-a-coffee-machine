The program should repeatedly ask what the user wants to do. If the user types "buy", "fill" or "take", then just do what the program did it action. "Buy" -  you have to choise from 3 sort of coffee with different ingredient. "Fill" - you can add ingredients in coffee-machine. "Take" - we take a money from it. However, if the user wants to switch off the coffee machine, he should type "exit". Then the program should terminate. Also, when the user types "remaining", the program should output all the resources that the coffee machine has. This means that you shouldn't show the remaining stock levels at the beginning/end of the program.

Also, do not forget that you can be out of resources for making coffee. If the coffee machine doesn’t have enough resources to make coffee, the program should output a message that says it can't make a cup of coffee and state what is missing.

And the last improvement to the program at this step—if the user types "buy" to buy a cup of coffee and then changes his mind, he should be able to type "back" to return into the main cycle.

Remember, that:

For the espresso, the coffee machine needs 250 ml of water and 16 g of coffee beans. It costs $4.
For the latte, the coffee machine needs 350 ml of water, 75 ml of milk, and 20 g of coffee beans. It costs $7.
And for the cappuccino, the coffee machine needs 200 ml of water, 100 ml of milk, and 12 g of coffee. It costs $6.
Instruction
Write a program that will work endlessly to make coffee for all interested persons until the shutdown signal is given.

Example
Your coffee machine should have the same initial resources as in the example (400 ml of water, 540 ml of milk, 120 g of coffee beans, 9 disposable cups, $550 in cash).
